# Question Randomizer Microservice  
### Developed by Ryan Doering  

---
---
Overview:
This microservice allows users to request a specific number of random questions from a larger pool of questions. It supports reducing the likelihood of previously selected questions being chosen again and ensures reliable, non-duplicative question selection. It uses python.

Requesting Data:
    Endpoint :POST /randomize

    Request Parameters

    The microservice accepts a JSON payload with the following keys:

    num_questions (integer): The number of questions to select.
    total_questions (integer): The total number of available questions.
    previously_selected (optional, array of integers): A list of previously selected question numbers.
    Example Request: payload = {
        "num_questions": 5,
        "total_questions": 50,
        "previously_selected": [3, 8, 15]
    }

Receiving Data:
    Returns a JSON object containing an array of randomly selected question numbers.
    Example Success Response:
    {
    "selected_questions": [4, 10, 23, 36, 42]
    }


    Returns a JSON object with an error message if the request parameters are invalid.
    Example:
    {
    "error": "Number of questions requested exceeds available questions."
    }   

Instructions for Use:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
    pip install flask
    pip install requests
3. Run the microservice: (The microservice runs at "http://localhost:5000/randomize")
    python randomizer_microservice.py
4. Make a request to the microservice:
    import requests
    payload = {
        "num_questions": 5,
        "total_questions": 50,
        "previously_selected": [3, 8, 15]
    }

    response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/randomize", json=payload)

    print(response.json())
